Emacs Configuration TODO List

* TODO [#A] Fix keybindings for highlight-symbol for only in highlight-symbol mode.
  This might not be possible, because highlight-symbol doesn't have a
  mode map or even a hook.
* TODO [#A] Learn about flycheck as a substitute for flymake (with elpy).
* TODO [#A] Change the README to a personal one.
* TODO [#A] On my Mac, start Emacs maximized or in fullscreen.
  - Fullscreen would be easy, just call
    =ns-toggle-fullscreen=. However, I'd prefer maximized.
  - Got it to work with [[https://github.com/rmm5t/maxframe.el][maxframe.el]]. However, only the first frame
    created opens up maximized. Further frames can be maximized with
    =maximize frame= or its alias =mf=. Luckily I mostly use one
    frame.
* TODO [#A] Keybindings for jump-char and ace-jump-mode
  They conflict with org-mode and others. Figure something out.
** Solution
   - Vendorize Drew Adams' misc-cmds.el.
   - Map =C-a= to toggle between indentation or beginning of line.
   - Remap =jump-char-forward= to =M-m= and =jump-char-backward= to =M-M=.
* TODO [#B] Check out automatic tag file switching.
* TODO [#B] Report Aquamacs crashing during crash report.
* TODO [#B] Report and send in patches for getting Skim to work with SyncTeX.
* TODO [#B] Send in patch to Prelude for not overwriting values for TeX builder.
* TODO [#B] Send in patch to Prelude for SyncTeX.
* TODO [#C] Fillcode package.
  May not be necessary, code is filling alright using elpy.
* TODO [#C] Fix suboptimal keybinding configuration of =comment-or-uncomment-region-or-line=.
  Not sure if it's suboptimal. I bound it to =M-;=, and I haven't been
  in want of =comment-region= yet.
* TODO [#C] Keep working on SyncTeX with AUCTeX and Skim.
* TODO [#C] Try out the new Aquamacs nightly build.
  Consider donating if it's good.
* TODO [#C] Learn how to use RefTeX.
* TODO [#C] Fixed width font for rst-mode.
* TODO [#C] Add note about getting spell checking working on Mac OS X.
  Done with homebrew by using =brew install aspell --lang=en=.
* TODO [#C] nxHTML package.
* TODO [#C] Try out viper-mode.
* TODO [#C] buffer-move and switch-window are very similar.
  Consider nuking one of them.
* DONE [#B] Check out diminish.el for cutting down on the mode line.

  It *should* be at 79 characters. Get =whitespace-mode=, =fill-column-indicator=, and =fill-paragraph= to play nicely together.
