Emacs Configuration TODO List

* TODO [#A] Get ruby-block mode off in non-Ruby buffers.
** Submitted a pull request to a questionably official [[https://github.com/adolfosousa/ruby-block.el][ruby-block Github repo]]. Waiting on the response.
* TODO [#A] Learn about flycheck as a substitute for flymake (with elpy).
* TODO [#B] Add a command to directly open up the Emacs configuration repo.
  Could be done with something like =pwd > somefile= in the =Makefile=.
* TODO [#B] Amend =package.el= functionality to show a buffer with just packages that need updating.
  - This will be similar to the =U= key, which runs =package-menu-mark-upgrades=.
  - =package-menu--find-upgrades= is the one at which you want to look.
* TODO [#B] Check out automatic tag file switching.
* TODO [#B] Fix fontset for Unicode.

  - See =aquamacs/src/site-lisp/macosx/aquamacs-mac-fontsets.el= in
    the Aquamacs distribution.
* TODO [#B] Report and send in patches for getting Skim to work with SyncTeX.
* TODO [#B] Report Aquamacs crashing during crash report.
* TODO [#B] Send in patch to Prelude for not overwriting values for TeX builder.
* TODO [#B] Send in patch to Prelude for SyncTeX.
* TODO [#B] Consider adding in some =eval-after-load= blocks.
* TODO [#C] Add note about getting spell checking working on Mac OS X.
  Done with homebrew by using =brew install aspell --lang=en=.
* TODO [#C] buffer-move and switch-window are very similar.
  Consider nuking one of them.
* TODO [#C] Consider byte compilation of init files and vendorized code.
* TODO [#C] Figure out autoloads for vendorized packages.
* TODO [#C] Fillcode package.
  May not be necessary, code is filling alright using elpy.
* TODO [#C] Fix keybindings for highlight-symbol for only in highlight-symbol mode.
  - This might not be possible, because highlight-symbol doesn't have a
    mode map or even a hook.
  - Right now they are just global.
* TODO [#C] Fix suboptimal keybinding configuration of =comment-or-uncomment-region-or-line=.
  Not sure if it's suboptimal. I bound it to =M-;=, and I haven't been
  in want of =comment-region= yet.
* TODO [#C] Fixed width font for rst-mode.
* TODO [#C] Keep working on SyncTeX with AUCTeX and Skim.
  It seems I'll have to use AppleScript. According to [[http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/skim-app/index.php?title=TeX_and_PDF_Synchronization][this page]],
  AppleScript is the best way to get auto-revert /and/ forward search
  (editor to viewer).
* TODO [#C] Learn how to use RefTeX.
* TODO [#C] nxHTML package.
* TODO [#C] Try out the new Aquamacs nightly build.
  Consider donating if it's good.
* TODO [#C] Try out viper-mode.
* DONE [#A] Change the README to a personal one.

* DONE [#A] Check out [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]].
  CLOSED: [2013-02-22 Fri 20:20]
* DONE [#A] Keybindings for jump-char and ace-jump-mode
  CLOSED: [2013-02-22 Fri 21:30]
  They conflict with org-mode and others. Figure something out.
** Solution
   - Vendorize Drew Adams' misc-cmds.el.
   - Map =C-a= to toggle between indentation or beginning of line.
   - Remap =jump-char-forward= to =M-m= and =jump-char-backward= to =M-M=.
* DONE [#A] On my Mac, start Emacs maximized or in fullscreen.
  CLOSED: [2013-02-22 Fri 21:31]
  - Fullscreen would be easy, just call
    =ns-toggle-fullscreen=. However, I'd prefer maximized.
  - Got it to work with [[https://github.com/rmm5t/maxframe.el][maxframe.el]]. However, only the first frame
    created opens up maximized. Further frames can be maximized with
    =maximize frame= or its alias =mf=. Luckily I mostly use one
    frame.
* DONE [#B] Check out diminish.el for cutting down on the mode line.
  CLOSED: [2013-02-22 Fri 20:21]
  Done as part of use-package update.
* DONE Fix wrap, width alignment, etc. for Python-mode.

  It *should* be at 79 characters. Get =whitespace-mode=, =fill-column-indicator=, and =fill-paragraph= to play nicely together.
