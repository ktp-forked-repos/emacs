Notes About Filling

Mostly, this has to do with fixing the Python =fill-column= (or column
limit, or wrap width, or what-have-you) to use 79 characters instead
of 80, or 70, etc. It needs to be consistent between the following
things:

- fill-column
- fill-column-indicator
  Influential variable is =fci-rule-column=.
- whitespace-mode

Looks like fill-column-indicator will cooperate with fill-column by default.
